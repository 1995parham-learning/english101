## Introduction

These are the example sentences that I wrote to review on English concepts.
Also, there are [Words](./words.org) that I collected to review and learn their definition.

## Notes

These are points that I heard about my English or the phrases that I heard,
and I am gathering them here.

- It is better to say 'I code alone' instead of saying 'I code lonely' because lonely has a negative tone. (@elahe.dstn)
- "To hear something straight from the horse's mouth" means that you heard the information from someone who has personal knowledge on the spoken matter
